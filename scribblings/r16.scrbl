@title{R16 â€” Community-Driven Interactive Code Evaluation}

R16 is a "trick bot". It saves snippets of code, which can then be recalled and executed on user-provided input.

This manual is structured by frontend. A frontend is a way through which users can interact with
the bot.

@section{Configuration}

The bot is run by invoking its @tt{main.rkt} file, and stores its configuration in a JSON
file that is read on startup. See the @tt{-h} output for precise details about
command-line flags.

The configuration file must contain a top level object with the following keys and
associated values:

@itemlist[
@item{@tt{storage}: A string defining the folder in which to store the bot's save data.}
@item{@tt{frontends}: A list of objects. Within each object, the @tt{module} key must have a
string value that is a module path as in @racket[dynamic-require] which identifies a frontend to run.
Frontends may require more specific configuration within this object, see the documentation
of your chosen frontend for more details.}
]

A working default configuration for the Discord frontend:
@codeblock|{
{
  "storage": "/home/r16bot/r16_save_data",
  "frontends": [
    {
      "module": "r16/frontends/discord",
      "bot_token": "<your bot token here>"
    }
  ]
}
}|

@section{The Trick Environment}

Tricks are stored as plain text, and invoked in a sandbox using @racketmodname[racket/sandbox].

The following values are available in the sandbox's namespace:

@itemlist[
@item{All symbols exported by @racketmodname[threading], for convenience.}
@item{All items listed below.}
@item{Any items made available by the specific frontend, see the documentation of your chosen
frontend for details.}
]

@defproc[(call-trick [name (or/c symbol? string?)]
                     [argument any/c]) any/c]{
Invokes another trick named by @racket[name] and return its result.
If @racket[argument] is @racket[#f], then an empty string is passed to the subtrick. Otherwise, @racket[(~a argument)] is passed.
}

@defthing[string-args string?]{
Text of the message after the bot command, as a string.
}

@defthing[trick-name string?]{
The name of the currently running trick, as a string. For ad-hoc evaluations, the string is empty.
}

@defproc[(read-args) (or/c (listof any/c) #f)]{
Function that returns @racket[string-args], but as a list of datums read by @racket[read]. If there is a read failure, @racket[#f] is returned.
}

@defthing[parent-context (or/c (hash/c symbol? any/c) #f)]{
If the currently executing trick is a top-level trick invocation, @racket[#f]. Otherwise,
a mapping of all the provided symbols (such as @racket[string-args], etc.) in the context
of the parent that executed @racket[call-trick].
}

@section{Discord Frontend}
This frontend provides integration with the Discord chat service.

Commands to the bot are issued by prefixing Discord messages with a configurable prefix
value. The rest of the message is then treated as a command. For more details, send the
message @tt{<bot_prefix> help} in your Discord server.

The frontend also has a configurable trick shorthand prefix. Messages of the form
@tt{<trick_prefix>foo bar ...} are equivalent to @tt{<bot_prefix> call foo bar ...}.

@subsection{Discord Configuration}
The @tt{frontend} object in the configuration file can have the following keys and values:
@itemlist[
@item{@tt{module} must be the string @code{"r16/frontends/discord"}.}
@item{@tt{bot_token} must be a string containing your Discord bot token.}
@item{@tt{bot_prefix} is a string specifying the bot's trigger prefix. If not present, defaults to @code{"!rkt "}.}
@item{@tt{trick_prefix} is a string specifying the bot's shorthand prefix. If not present, defaults to @code{"!!"}.}
@item{@tt{delete_time} is a nonnegative integer specifying a time in seconds. If any invocation of R16 is deleted within this time, then R16 will also delete its response.
This helps with spam due to incorrect trick invocations. If not present, defaults to 5 minutes (300 seconds). Set to 0 to disable this feature.}
]

@subsection{Discord Trick Environment Extensions}

In additional to the bindings described above, the following items are available in the
trick environment.

@defproc[(delete-caller) void?]{
Delete the message that invoked this sandbox.
}

@defproc[(emote-lookup [name string?]) (or/c string? #f)]{
Function that returns the ID for emote with name @racket[name], or @racket[#f] if it doesn't exist.
The emotes of the guild that the triggering message was sent in are searched first,
then the emotes of other guilds the bot is part of are searched in unspecified order.
}

@defproc[(emote-image [id string?]) (or/c bytes? #f)]{
Function that returns the PNG data of the emote with ID @racket[id], or @racket[#f] if it doesn't exist.
}

@defproc[(make-attachment [payload bytes?]
                          [name (or/c string? bytes?)]
                          [mime (or/c symbol? string? bytes?)]) any/c]{
Creates an attachment with payload @racket[payload], filename @racket[name], and MIME-type @racket[mime].
This object must be returned from the trick to be sent to Discord.
If more than one attachment is returned, an unspecified one is sent.
}

@defthing[message-contents string?]{
Full text of the message that invoked this trick.
}

@defproc[(read-storage [type (or/c 'guild 'channel 'user)]) any/c]{
Reads "trick-local storage" @racket[type] and return its result, or @racket[#f] if the result is uninitialized.

A trick's "trick-local storage" can be per-guild, per-channel, or per-user.

This will always return @racket[#f] for the eval command.
}

@defproc[(write-storage [type (or/c 'guild 'channel 'user)]
                        [data any/c]) boolean?]{
Writes @racket[data] to the trick's "trick-local storage," overwriting any existing value, and returns whether the write succeeded. All data supported by @racket[write] can be written.

A trick's "trick-local storage" can be per-guild, per-channel, or per-user; each type of storage has its own limitation on size:
@tabular[#:sep @hspace[1]
  `(,(list @bold{Type} @bold{Size Limit})
          ("guild"     "64 KiB")
          ("channel"   "8 KiB")
          ("user"      "2 KiB"))]
}

This will always be a no-op when invoked from the eval command.

@defproc[(attachment-data [attachment any/c]) bytes?]{
Get the payload of an attachment created with @racket[make-attachment].
}

@defproc[(open-attachment [index natural? 0]) (or/c input-port? #f)]{
Opens the @racket[index]th attachment of the message that invoked this sandbox, as an input port.

Returns @racket[#f] if the message doesn't have an @racket[index]th attachment, or
if the attachment couldn't be opened for any other reason.
}

@defproc[(open-reply-attachment [index natural? 0]) (or/c input-port? #f)]{
Same as @racket[open-attachment], except fetching the attachment of the message that the invoking message replied to.
}

@defthing[attachment-count natural?]{
The number of files attached to the message that invoked this sandbox.
}

@defthing[reply-attachment-count natural?]{
The number of files attached to the message that the invoking message replied to.
}

@defthing[reply-contents (or/c string? #f)]{
The full message content of the message that the invoking message replied to.
}

@section{HTTP Frontend}

The HTTP frontend turns R16 into a web application. On startup, R16 starts an HTTP server
on the local machine at the given port, which allows tricks to be registered and
called from HTML forms.

Caveat: R16 will only bind to localhost, and will not use TLS. Please set up a reverse
proxy with TLS termination in front of the bot if you plan to expose it to the internet.

@subsection{HTTP Frontend Configuration}
The @tt{frontend} object in the configuration file can have the following keys and values:
@itemlist[
@item{@tt{module} must be the string @racket["r16/frontends/http"].}
@item{@tt{port} is an integer specifying which port to bind the web server to. If not
present, defaults to @racket[8080].}
]

@subsection{HTTP Trick Environment Extensions}
In additional to the bindings described above, the following items are available in the
trick environment.

@defproc[(make-image [png-bytes bytes?]) any]{
Returns an opaque value representing a PNG image containing the given bytes. If a trick
invocation returns such a value, then the image is rendered to the user inline in the
browser.
}
